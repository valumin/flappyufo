                <h4>1) Flappy UFO</h4>
                <p class="game-description"><b>Game Description:</b> <br><br>Flappy bird was a mobile game from 2013. It was a sleeper hit, gaining sudden and massive popularity in 2014, likely due to attention from a popular YouTuber at that time. The game was removed from the App store after it’s sudden popularity due to negative media attention.

                    The game is extremely simple, and was designed to mimic the feeling of bouncing a ping pong ball on a paddle for as long as possible.
                    Flappy Bird is a popular first game for new developers, and is featured in many “first game” tutorials.</p>
